# Vercel Deployment Instructions

This guide is for users who deployed this template using the **Sanity + Vercel Integration** or **one-click Vercel deploy button**. It walks you through setting up your local development environment and deploying Sanity Studio.

## Step 1. Deploy to Vercel

If you haven't already, click the button below to deploy:

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)][vercel-deploy]

Follow the instructions on Vercel to complete the deployment. This will clone the repo to your GitHub account, deploy the Next.js web, and create a Sanity project via the Vercel integration.

## Step 2. Clone and install locally

Clone the repository that was created in your GitHub account and install dependencies:

```shell
git clone <your-new-repo-url>
cd <your-repo-name>
pnpm install
```

## Step 3. Pull environment variables

Link your local project to your Vercel project and pull the environment variables:

```shell
cd web && pnpm dlx vercel link && pnpm dlx vercel env pull .env.local && cd ..
```

The Vercel integration provisions environment variables for both the Next.js web (`NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET`, `SANITY_API_READ_TOKEN`, etc.) and Sanity Studio (`SANITY_STUDIO_PROJECT_ID`, `SANITY_STUDIO_DATASET`, etc.). Since each app only reads the variables it needs, you can use the same `.env.local` file for both:

```shell
cp web/.env.local studio/.env.local
```

## Step 4. Run locally

From the project root, start both the Next.js app and Sanity Studio:

```shell
pnpm dev
```

- Next.js runs on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- Sanity Studio runs on [http://localhost:3333](http://localhost:3333)

Sign in to the Studio with the same account you used during the Vercel/Sanity setup.

## Notes: schema extraction + typegen (important for Vercel builds)

This repo commits a generated schema file at `studio/schema.json`. This avoids relying on `.sanity/schema.json` (which is ignored by git) and ensures Vercel can run type generation during builds.

- If you change Studio schemas, regenerate the committed schema file:

```shell
pnpm --filter studio sanity:schema
```

- The Next.js build runs type generation automatically via `web`’s `prebuild` script.

## Step 5. Import sample data (optional)

To get started quickly with pre-built content, run:

```shell
pnpm import-sample-data
```

## Step 6. Deploy Sanity Studio

Deploy the Studio so your team can access it online:

```shell
cd studio && pnpm deploy
```

You will be prompted to choose a hostname (e.g., `your-project.sanity.studio`).

After deploying, update the `NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_STUDIO_URL` environment variable in your Vercel project settings to point to your deployed Studio URL (e.g., `https://your-project.sanity.studio`).

## Step 7. Invite collaborators (optional)

Visit [sanity.io/manage](https://www.sanity.io/manage), select your project, and click **"Invite project members"** to collaborate with your team.
